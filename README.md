# FintechIntro
I am full time day trader and technical analyst. I have 4 years of trading experience in the cryptocurrency markets.
My career goals are developing an automated trading system and moving to longer holding periods to focus more on research.
I chose Fintech as a career path because I wanted to better understand why and how money moves in the global economy.
